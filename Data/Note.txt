The eigenvalue data generated has been printed in each file in an incorrect form.

The intended form is:

	Eigenvalues: [(eigenvalue_1, multiplicity_1), (eigenvalue_2, multiplicity_2), ...]


For example, a file may say:


	Eigenvalues: [(26, 1), (-10, 1), (8, 2), (8, 2), (-1, 32), (-1, 32)]
	

When ideally it would say:

	Eigenvalues: [(26, 1), (-10, 1), (8, 2), (-1, 32)]

This bug has been fixed, so any more data generated will have the correct form.
